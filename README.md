# Scripts for ersky9x and Betaflight
Thanks @MikeBland for this <s>crap</s> awesome scripting language. JK, we all know 9XR Pro can't run Lua.
## What is already done
* PID control (Thanks @midelic, yout code formatting sucks. Basically this is his (or her?) file with readable indentation and stuff. Just look https://github.com/midelic/Ersky9x-Tx-bas-scripts)
* Push RSSI value (Lua scripts can push RTC as well but @MikeBland didn't give us a function for that)
## What is yet to be done
* VTX control: SmartAudio, Tramp, RTC6705
